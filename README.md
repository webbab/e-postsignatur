![HTML Email Signature Example](https://github.com/HigherEducation/email-signature/blob/master/example.jpg)

## Getting Started

1. Open [**Gmail**](https://mail.google.com/) _(you might need to switch users if you have multiple accounts)_
2. Open the [**Settings** page](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general)
3. On the *General* tab, scroll down to _Signature_
4. Click on the radio button to pick which email address you want to assign this signature to. If you have multiple emails, you'll need to repeat the next steps for each email address.
5. Open this page in a new tab in your browser: http://codepen.io/ericrasch/full/EKKyMW/
6. Click on the white area (to be sure you have the target area selected) then **Select all** (cmd-A on Mac; ctrl-A on Windows), then Copy (cmd-C on Mac; ctrl-C on Windows)
7. Go back to Gmail and **Paste** the signature you just copied into the blank Signature space in the Gmail Settings.
8. Click on each item in this signature to edit the details. Click once on the temp email address and click **Change** to edit that.
9. Scroll down and **Save Changes**
10. Send a test email to your BFF with your new, fancy email signature. While you're at it, be sure to actually click on your own email address link in the signature and test that you input it correctly.

_Pro Tip:_ To get this signature on your phone/device, it's probably easiest just to send yourself an email with the final signature in it, then copy and paste the new signature into your devices' mail app built-in settings. I personally tried this on my iPhone and it looked terrible. **I would really recommend keeping your device signatures as minimal, plain text.** Besides, you'll save on your data plan not having to send extra info. ;)
